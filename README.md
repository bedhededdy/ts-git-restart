## TODO: THERE IS AN ESLINT PLUGIN FOR JEST (eslint-plugin-jest) WE SHOULD PROBABLY SETUP ONCE WE GET TO TESTING

## TODO: SHOULD JEST CONFIG BE IN ROOT OR SHOUDL IT BE IN EACH PACKAGE?
##       PROBABLY A WAY TO EXTEND THE ROOT CONFIG AND SPECIFY SPECIFIC OPTIONS
##       IN EACH PACKAGE

## TODO: SHOULD COMMON PACKAGES BE STORED IN THE ROOT PACKAGE.JSON OR IN EACH PACKAGE INDIVIDUALLY? THINK IT SHOULD BE DONE IN ROOT

## TODO: TSCONFIG MAY NEED TO REFERENCE THE DEPENDENCY AND SET A RELATIVE PATH TO IT
##       THIS IS PROBABLY BETTER THAN READING THE DIST DIRECTORY

## TODO: SHOULD WE HAVE A REFERENCES SECTION IN THE ROOT TSCONFIG?
##       I GUESS WE SHOULD ALSO SET COMPOSITE IN THE PACKAGE SPECIFIC TSCONFIG
##       I GUESS WE SHOULD ALSO SET DEPENDENCY USING THE TS RELATIVE PATH IN THE PACKAGE SPECIFIC PACKAGE.JSON

## NOTE: IT WOULD APPEAR THAT TYPESCRIPT PROJECT REFERENCES DO NOT PLAY NICESLY
##       WITH PACKAGE.JSON EXPORTS, SO WE WILL PROBABLY NEED TO END UP
##       HAVING AN INDEX.TS FILE EXPORT ALL THE DEPENDENCIES

## FIXME: JEST DOES NOT SUPPORT ESMODULES, SO WE MORE OR LESS HAVE TO
##        SWITCH TO ANOTHER TESTING FRAMEWORK THAT HAS SUPPORT FOR ESMODULES

## TODO: PROBABLY SHOULD ALSO SET TYPE ON PACKAGE.JSON TO MODULE
##       TO WHOLLY AVOID THE CJS CLUSTERFUCK
